MODULE FOR SALE
    I am not planning to make any changes to this module as I have not been
    a customer of TMobile for over a year. If someone would like to take
    over maintenance/development of this module please get in touch.

ANTI-TMOBILE RANT
    TMobile's lax fraud prevention procedures allowed a random person in a
    random part of the UK to buy a mobile phone contract at my parents
    address. TMobile then started to demand money from my parents and
    ignored initial attempts to explain that the person has a different name
    from the residents and has never lived at their address. TMobile
    eventually, after much chasing, agreed to stop demanding money that my
    family did not owe them, but they to date have not properly apologied
    for their actions or explained how on earth this person was able to
    setup the phone contract in the first place.

    I encourage people not to use T-Mobile.
